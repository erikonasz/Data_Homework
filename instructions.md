## Task #1 Instructions:

- Open the code with Jupyter Notebook 
- Ensure that the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory. In this case, the dataset should be in the "data/clicks" folder, with multiple CSV files containing the data.
- Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially from the beginning to the end.
- The script will process the input data using the MapReduce framework and write the results to a new CSV file located at "data/total_clicks/clicks_per_day.csv".


## Task #2 Instructions:

- Open the code with Jupyter Notebook 
- Ensure that the datasets are placed in the appropriate directories. In this case, the "data/users" and "data/clicks" folders should contain multiple CSV files with user and click data, respectively.
- Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially from the beginning to the end.
- The script will process the input data using the MapReduce framework and write the results to a new CSV file located at "data/filtered_clicks/filtered_output.csv".
